## Project Summary

MyTube is a platform designed for content creators and marketers. It has the potential to be a powerful tool designed to offer features that help users make informed decisions of their video content or marketing strategy. After secure user authentication, users can tap into a dynamic feed of real-time trending videos, segmented by categories, tags, or even specific creators. What sets this app apart is its focus on actionable insights.

Our web application is designed to be user-friendly, offering an intuitive interface that even first-time users would find it easy to navigate. The utility of this app offers analytics dashboards that provide an in-depth look at how videos and categories are trending over time, providing valuable insights for content creation and marketing strategies. By examining this data, creators can pinpoint the best time to release new content, or which topics are gaining traction. Marketers, too, can identify high-potential topics or creators to partner with.
